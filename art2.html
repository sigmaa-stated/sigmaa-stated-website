<h3>Article II. Activities </h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section 1</strong>. This SIGMAA will engage in activities such as, 
  but not limited to, the following: 
  <ul>
    <li>a) Hold an annual meeting in conjunction with the Joint Mathematical 
    Meetings, 
    <li>b) Sponsor sessions in connection with the Joint Mathematical Meetings, 
    <li>c) Maintain an e-mail list to facilitate communication among members, 
    <li>d) Publish a newsletter and maintaining a web page of links related to 
    undergraduate statistics, 
    <li>e) Promote the publication of articles related to undergraduate 
    statistics in MAA publications, and 
    <li>f) Encourage similar activities among (regional) sections of the MAA. 
    </li></ul>
  <li><strong>Section 2</strong>. Relationship with MAA Activities 
  <ul>
    <li>a. The ASA/MAA Joint Committee on Undergraduate Statistics Education. 
    Opportunities for cooperation between the SIGMAA and the Committee abound. 
    While the Committee's charge is to address issues of curriculum, pedagogy, 
    and faculty development, the SIGMAA will provide a group that can work at a 
    more "grass roots" level to implement various initiatives. It is also 
    expected that the SIGMAA will provide a means of communicating needs and 
    concerns for the Committee's consideration. To facilitate this communication 
    in both directions, it is expected that MAA representatives will join the 
    SIGMAA and that SIGMAA officers will attend the meetings of the Committee. 
    This SIGMAA will also aim to contribute to the work of other MAA committees 
    whose charges concern statistics education. Examples include the Committee 
    on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics and the Committee on 
    Professional Development. This SIGMAA will also seek to work closely with 
    the analogous group within the American Statistical Association - its 
    Section on Statistical Education, and with similar groups committed to 
    statistics education within other organizations. 
    <li>b. No activity of this SIGMAA, including publications, shall be 
    represented as coming from the MAA at large, but rather from this SIGMAA, 
    unless such activity and representation have been approved by the Executive 
    Committee of the MAA. c. Reports of this SIGMAA's activities shall be 
    included in an annual report submitted by the SIGMAA to the MAA Committee on 
    SIGMAAs, with copies to the chair of the Coordinating Council to which the 
    SIGMAA is assigned. </li></ul></li></ul></div>
