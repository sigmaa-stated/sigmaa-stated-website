<h3>Article III. Meetings </h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Section 1</strong>. Frequency and place of meetings. The general 
  membership meeting of this SIGMAA shall take place at the January Joint 
  Mathematics Meetings. Other activities may be scheduled at the summer MAA 
  meeting and at MAA Section meetings. SIGMAA business may also be conducted by 
  e-mail provided that a quorum is attained. 
  <li><strong>Section 2.</strong> Conduct of meetings. The SIGMAA Chair shall 
  preside over the annual business meeting. The Chair will circulate an agenda 
  via e-mail one month in advance and will ask for additional agenda items at 
  that time. The Chair will allow ample time for discussion and will seek to 
  achieve consensus. When a consensus is not reached, decisions will be made by 
  a vote using Robert's Rules of Order. When the Executive Committee decides 
  that an issue requires attention of the entire SIGMAA before the next general 
  meetings, it may conduct a business meeting over e-mail. The same definition 
  of a quorum applies to any vote taken over e-mail, and again it is expected 
  that ample time for discussion will be allowed. Members will be given at least 
  two weeks to vote on any issue requiring a vote over e-mail. 
  <li><strong>Section 3.</strong> A quorum at membership meetings, including 
  e-mail meetings, shall consist of at least 20 members and at least three 
  officers. At least two of the three officers must be elected, as opposed to 
  appointed officers. </li></ul></div>
