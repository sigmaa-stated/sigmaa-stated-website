<h2>SIGMAA on Statistics Education Charter</h2>
<h3>Article V. Officers</h3>
<div 
style="PADDING-RIGHT: 5px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; FLOAT: left; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px"></div>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;<strong>Section 1</strong>. Elected officers of this SIGMAA will be 
  the Chair, Secretary, and Treasurer. The Chair-Elect, Chair, Past-Chair, 
  Secretary and Treasurer comprise the Executive Committee. The Newsletter 
  Editor and Webmaster are appointed officers. The Chair-Elect/Chair/Past-Chair 
  will serve for a three year term, with one year in each office. The Secretary 
  and Treasurer will serve staggered two-year terms. Terms will begin at the 
  conclusion of the January Joint Mathematics Meetings. 
  <li><strong>Section 2</strong>. Duties of officers: 
  <ul>
    <li><em><strong>The Chair</strong></em> will preside at SIGMAA meetings, 
    will organize and direct the activities of the group, will serve as liaison 
    with the MAA administration and with other organizations that work with 
    statistics education, and will be the chief spokesperson for the SIGMAA. In 
    this last capacity the Chair will write a regular column for the newsletter 
    and for the web page to keep members apprised of SIGMAA activities. The 
    Chair also appoints the Newsletter editor and Webmaster. 
    <li>In addition to assisting the Chair, <strong><em>the 
    Chair-Elect</em></strong> will serve as Program Coordinator for the SIGMAA's 
    sessions at the Joint Mathematics Meetings. In this capacity the Chair-Elect 
    will propose sessions after consulting with other officers and will arrange 
    for their implementation. 
    <li>In addition to assisting the Chair and Chair-Elect, <em><strong>the 
    Past-Chair</strong></em> will serve as the Nominations Officer, working with 
    the rest of the Executive Committee to select a slate of candidates for the 
    two offices (Chair-Elect and either Secretary or Treasurer) open in any 
    year. The Past-Chair will solicit suggestions and volunteers for serving as 
    officers from the membership. 
    <li><strong><em>The Secretary</em></strong> will keep a record of the 
    affairs of the SIGMAA, handle correspondence, and submit written reports to 
    the MAA as required. 
    <li><strong><em>The Treasurer</em></strong> will be responsible for all 
    finances of the SIGMAA and for preparation of financial reports as required. 

    <li><em><strong>The Newsletter Editor</strong></em> will be responsible for 
    dissemination of information to the SIGMAA membership through their 
    respective media. 
    <li><strong><em>The Webmaster</em></strong> will be responsible for 
    maintenance and updates to the SIGMAA website. </li></ul>
  <li><strong>Section 3</strong>. Elections, Appointments, and Terms of Office 
  <ul>
    <li>1. Nomination and Election of officers will take place by electronic 
    ballot of the membership. By October 1 the Past-Chair will select two 
    candidates for each of the two open positions and the MAA will distribute an 
    electronic ballot to members with instructions for voting by October 31. The 
    electronic ballot will indicate that write-in votes are permitted. A minimum 
    of 20 members must vote for each position. The winner will be the candidate 
    receiving the most votes. The Past-Chair will be responsible for overseeing 
    the tabulation of the ballots. Ties will be broken by a fair, unbiased 
    random device supervised by the MAA. If the minimum of 20 members do not 
    vote, the current officers will remain in office until a quorum is achieved. 

    <li>&nbsp;2. Should an office other than Chair become vacant midterm, the 
    Executive Committee of the SIGMAA, in consultation with the most recent 
    Nominating Officer, shall appoint a member of the SIGMAA to fill that office 
    for the remainder of the term of office. Should the office of Chair of the 
    SIGMAA become vacant midterm, the Executive Committee, in consultation with 
    the most recent Nominating Officer, shall appoint a member of the Executive 
    Committee to fill the office of Chair for the remainder of the term and 
    shall fill the vacant position according to the rules just given. Note: The 
    use of the term "e-mail" throughout this document shall be understood to 
    refer to any widely accepted form of electronic communication. Members may 
    always request hard copy rather than e-mail notification regarding election 
    ballots and/or proposed charter changes. </li></ul></li></ul></div>
