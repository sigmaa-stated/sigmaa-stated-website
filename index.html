<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>The purpose of this SIGMAA is to facilitate the exchange of ideas about teaching statistics, the undergraduate statistics curriculum and all other issues related to providing students with effective and engaging encounters with statistics in their courses of study.&nbsp; We also hope to foster increased understanding of statistics among members of the MAA, promote the discipline of statistics among students, and work cooperatively with other organizations to encourage effective teaching and learning of statistics.</p>

<h2>Robert V. Hogg Award</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Special Interest Group of the Mathematical Association of America (SIGMAA) on Statistics Education is now accepting nominations for the inaugural Robert V. Hogg Award For Excellence in Teaching Introductory Statistics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This award provides recognition to an individual who has been teaching introductory statistics at the college level for between three (3) and fifteen (15) years, and who has shown both excellence and growth in teaching during that time. It is named in honor of Robert V. Hogg, winner of numerous teaching accolades including the Iowa Governor&rsquo;s Science Medal for Teaching in 1990 and the MAA&rsquo;s Distinguished Teaching award in 1993. Hogg was also a passionate advocate for statistics education who served as the President of the American Statistical Association in 1988.</p>
