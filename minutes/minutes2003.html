<center><b>Minutes of the 2003 SIGMAA meeting at the Joint Mathematics 
Meetings</b> <br><b>Thursday, January 16, 2003, 6:00 – 8:00 pm</b> 
<br>Baltimore, Maryland</center>
<p><br><br>
<p><b>Those in Attendance</b> <br>Thirty-seven people attended the meeting. 
Their names and school affiliations are listed at the end of the minutes. 
<p><a name="Reception"></a><b>Reception</b> <br>The meeting began with a 
reception. 
<p><a name="Chair"></a><b>Welcome</b> <br>Mary Sullivan, chair, welcomed everyone 
and opened the meeting by having everyone introduce themselves. 
<p><b>I. Approval of Minutes</b> <br>The minutes from the January 8, 2002 
meeting were approved and the correction that Mary Sullivan’s term as chair is 
from 2002-2003 was made (<a

<br><a 
href="http://www.pasles.org/sigmaastat/minutes2002.html">minutes2002.html</a>). 
<p><b>II. Chair’s Report</b> <br>Bob Hollister, treasurer, reported on the 
success of the quality control field trip to Ben &amp; Jerry’s during the 
MathFest in Burlington, Vermont, August 1-3, 2002. 
<p>Mary announced that the 2003 MathFest will be held in Boulder, Colorado, July 
31-August 2. An excursion will be planned. Please send ideas for a field trip to 
an officer very quickly. The officers will work to make sure everyone is 
informed about this opportunity. Members who would like to volunteer to lead the 
field trip in Boulder should contact Mary. 
<p>Mary asked for assistance with getting email addresses for members. She 
stressed that the main form of communication with members is electronic. To help 
with communication, once a year the MAA will help the SIGMAA send a written 
mailing to members. Bob Hollister pointed out that updating your contact 
information on the Combined Membership List does not automatically update your 
information with your individual memberships. Those individual organizations 
will need to be contacted separately. 
<p>At this year’s Joint Math Meetings, the SIGMAA on Statistics Education 
sponsored two contributed paper sessions on "Best Statistics 
Projects/Activities." The SIGMAA also organized a panel discussion on "The State 
of Statistics Education." Mary encouraged everyone to attend those events. 
<p><a name="Treasurer"></a><b><font size="+1">III. Treasurer’s Report</font></b> 
<br>Bob Hollister, treasurer, reported that expenditures for food at the 2002 
Joint Math Meetings and for field trip travel during the 2002 MathFest total 
$1,109.13.&nbsp; The incoming revenue of $5,217.50 was mostly from dues. The 
2002 year-end balance was $8,779.05.

  <li>Website <br>The SIGMAA website is found at <a 
  href="http://www.pasles.com/sigmaastat/">http://www.pasles.com/sigmaastat/</a>. 
  You can also access the website from the MAA page (<a 
  href="http://www.maa.org/">www.maa.org</a>) by selecting the link for the 
  SIGMAAs. 
  <li><a name="New"></a>Electronic Mailing List <br>Dex Whittinghill, past-chair, 
  and colleagues at Rowan University have been maintaining the SIGMAA on 
  Statistics Education email list. In the relatively near future, the MAA will 
  take over the activity of managing the email list for the SIGMAA. At that 
  time, Dex will send out instructions for how to change from the current list 
  to the new list. Until then, the email list will remain at <a 
  href="mailto:sigmaastat@majordomo.rowan.edu">sigmaastat@majordomo.rowan.edu</a>. 
  Dex reminded everyone that they must be members of the MAA and the SIGMAA on 
  Statistics Education to participate in this electronic form of communication. 
  <li>Newsletter <br>The first issue of the SIGMAA on Statistics Education was 
  sent out electronically this last year (<a 
  href="http://www.pasles.org/sigmaastat/newsletter1.html">http://www.pasles.org/sigmaastat/newsletter1.html</a>). 
  Pat Humprey encouraged people to submit items to the newsletter. She would 
  like to receive a report on the meeting, book reviews, suggestions for 
  teaching, and etc. Her email address is <font face="Arial Unicode MS"><a 
  href="mailto:phumphre@gasou.edu">phumphre@gasou.edu</a></font>. The newsletter 
  is posted on the SIGMAA website at <a 
  href="http://www.pasles.com/sigmaastat/">http://www.pasles.com/sigmaastat/</a>.</li></ol>
<p><br><b><font size="+1">VI. New Business</font></b> <br><b>A. Miscellaneous 
Announcements</b> 
<p>Mary announced a few items that might interest members. 
<ul>
  <li>The MAA PREP Course in Regression by Richard Scheaffer and Jeffery Witmer 
  will be offered again this year at Oberlin College in Ohio, July 23-27. To 
  learn more go to http://www.maa.org/pfdev/prep/prep.html. This year there will 
  be a $100 registration fee in addition to travel cost for the attendee to pay. 

  <li>The new "Math for Business Decisions" interactive on-line course has a 
  chapter in probability. 
  <li>See our website (soon) for more information about the ASA 
  endorsement/response to MAA "Guidelines for Programs and Departments in 
  Undergraduate Mathematical Sciences."&nbsp; The MAA guidelines can be found 
  at: <a 
  href="http://www.maa.org/guidelines/guidelines.html/t_blank">http://www.maa.org/guidelines/guidelines.html</a>. 
  </li></ul>Bob delMas, University of Minnesota, told members about a new NSF 
project that he is working on with Beth Chance and Joan Garfield. The project is 
called ARTIST and stands for Assessment Resource Tools for Improving Statistical 
Thinking. He invited us to participate by being classroom testers or by 
providing items for the project. More information can be found at <a 
href="http://www.gen.umn.edu/artist">http://www.gen.umn.edu/artist</a>. 
<p>Carolyn Cuff, chair-elect, reported that the SIGMAA submitted to sponsor a 
contributed paper session called "Discourse on Inference" at the 2004 Joint 
Mathematics Meetings in Phoenix, January 7-10. In this proposed session, the 
speakers would present ways in which they have for successfully teaching 
confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, statistical power, and the 
interpretation of such results. Carolyn also announced that the SIGMAA has 
proposed a panel discussion on teaching mathematical statistics courses. 
<p>John McKenzie, Babson College, reminded everyone that the AP Statistics 
course is very popular and that graders are needed for the mid-June grading 
event. 
<p>Adele Marie Rothan, College of Saint Catherine, let people know that the ASA 
booth at the exhibit has a survey that we could use to let them know what short 
courses we would like to be offered at the Joint Statistics Meeting. She 
suggested that we could encourage them to offer some less expensive courses on 
topics like teaching a second course in statistics or a course in experimental 
design, and etc. 
<p>Chris Lacke, Rowan University, is interested in finding out if there is a 
demand for an on-line chat site for students who are preparing for the actuarial 
exams.&nbsp; If you are interested, please contact Chris at <a 
href="mailto:lacke@rowan.edu">lacke@rowan.edu</a>. 
<p>Jim Albert, Bowling Green University, announced that he is the new editor for 
"The American Statistician" and they are looking for papers related to teaching 
statistics. There is not a backlog of papers in this area. Also, if you have 
ideas for topics for special sections of papers, please let him know. His email 
is <a href="mailto:albert@bgnet.bgsu.edu">albert@bgnet.bgsu.edu</a>. 
<p>Brian Smith, McGill University, informed members that the 2003 AMATYC meeting 
will be held in Salt Lake City. February 15<sup>th</sup> is the deadline for 
paper submissions. More information can be found at <a 
href="http://www.amatyc.org/">www.amatyc.org</a>. 
<p>Mary Sullivan, chair, announced that she and Carolyn Cuff, chair-elect, were 
contacted about the possibility of creating an edited volume for MAA Notes 
related to best practices in the introduction statistics course. Mary said that 
members were welcome to send papers to her and she would coordinate efforts to 
create a volume. 
<p>John McKenzie encouraged involvement from the members of the SIGMAA. He 
suggested that anyone interested in volunteering to help the organization should 
contact an officer. "The more volunteers – the better." <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; 
<p>The business meeting was closed, and the members participated in an 
interactive session in a small group format reviewing a prototype magazine of 
the American Statistical Association to provide feedback, per their request, on 
this prospective new publication. The tentative name for this publication is 
"Inference", and it is aimed at promoting an understanding of and an 
appreciation for statistics. Attendees received a copy of the prototype 
publication. Small groups read an article, discussed it, and provided responses 
to a brief survey. Mary will forward the responses to ASA.
