<p><font size="+1">Dear members of the SIGMAA on Statistics Education,</font> 
<p><font size="+1">This is my first ‘Letter from the Chair’ after my big, 
I-hope-welcoming, letter from March, and my short e-mail that I sent just 
recently (before I realized every e-mail to you should be a ‘Letter from the 
Chair’!).</font> <br>&nbsp; 
<h1><font size="+1">San Diego JMMs</font></h1>
<p><br><font size="+1">First, I hope that I see lots of you in San Diego this 
January. I did not go in 1997, so I am especially looking forward to the 
meetings. Would anyone like to look into getting Shark tickets for those 
interested? [The statisticians usually go to a baseball game in August, but we 
would have to see hockey, indoor soccer, or … ?]</font> 
<p><font size="+1">Second, I would like to point out that the May/June 2001 FOCUS 
has the ‘Preliminary Announcement’ for the Contributed Paper Sessions in San 
Diego (p22). Please contribute to any of them, but consider the two Stat Ed 
sponsored ones first:</font> 
<p><font size="+1">MAA CP J1, Best Practices in Undergraduate Statistics 
Education,</font> 
<p><font size="+1">MAA CP Q1, Innovative Outcome Assessment in Statistics 
Education.</font> 
<p><font size="+1">The official ‘Call for Papers’ may be on page 25. See <a 
href="http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2049_intro.html">http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2049_intro.html</a> 
for the latest, posted information on what else is going on at the 
meetings.</font> 
<p><font size="+1">Third, we are co-sponsoring a Panel with the MAA Committee on 
the Profession. It is titled "Life After a Math Sciences Major: Tracking and 
Using Alumni Career Information" and the abstract is below in the PS.</font> 
<p><font size="+1">Fourth, please note that the SIGMAA on Stat Ed business meeting 
will be on Friday night, January 8, from 6-8pm. We will have the business 
meeting at 6, and then at 7, Roxy Peck of California Polytechnic State 
University (at San Luis Obispo), current Chief Faculty Consultant for the AP 
Statistics exam, will speak on the AP Statistics exam!</font> <br>&nbsp; 
<h1><font size="+1">SIGMAA Services</font></h1>
<p><br><font size="+1">First, with luck, within a few days we should have a fetal 
web page up. Paul Pasles and Francisco Alarcon have been working on this and 
will be anxiously awaiting your suggestions.</font> 
<p><font size="+1">Second, I have corrected 13 of 24 bogus web addresses that I 
received from the MAA, and am waiting to hear from 7 others. Four are overseas 
members, so if any of you are good at deciphering e-mail addresses or hunting 
down folks, feel free to volunteer to help. IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE 13 whose first 
SIGMAA message from me is this e-mail, then please let me know.</font> 
<p><font size="+1">Third, I still need some volunteers for the newsletter. The 
three editors will need help with ‘column editors,’ and we have run into some 
conflicts. [I would like a format by the end of August and a newsletter out by 
mid-fall.]</font> 
<p><font size="+1">I hope you all have a good summer. (I think that I forgot 
something else, but I want to get this out!)</font>

<br><font size="+1">P.S.&nbsp; <b>Life After a Math Sciences Major: Tracking and 
Using Alumni Career Information</b></font> 
<p><font size="+1">The career paths of alumnae/alumni of undergraduate mathematics 
and mathematical sciences programs lead to diverse careers in which mathematical 
skills are crucial to success. Many of these paths lead to completion of 
graduate or professional programs in a wide variety of disciplines. Making 
students aware of the variety of career options can attract many students to 
programs in the mathematical sciences. Panelist Andrew Sterrett will address the 
variety of careers and graduate programs in which mathematical sciences alumni 
are involved. Panelists David Lutzer, Laura Person, and Lisa Traynor will 
describe how they have collected career information from alumnae/alumni of 
mathematics programs at William and Mary, SUNY at Potsdam, and Bryn Mawr, 
respectively, and how that feedback has been used in advising students and in 
planning and adjusting programs at these colleges and universities.</font>
