<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hello. This is the first edition of the SIGMAA on 
Statistics Education Newsletter. I finally got some submissions! For all you 
members out there, we hope to have a significant means of communication. I can’t 
be the sole writer of this communication, so please send submissions to me (Pat 
Humphrey, <b><u><font color="#0000ff">phumphre@gasou.edu</font></u></b>.) Almost 
anything of interest to those who teach statistics – interesting web sites, 
textbook reviews (there’s always that decision to be made, calendar items, short 
articles is considered of value here. Let’s hope that we can continue to 
prosper.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

SIGMAA Chair</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is hard to believe we are nearing the halfway 
point in the fall semester, and that the next JMMs are around the corner. I 
guess I have reached that age where time really does fly! I hope that this 
letter finds all of you well and enjoying your semester.</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SIGMAA sponsored its first field trip - a 
visit to Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream in Vermont this past August as part of 
MathFest. Bob Hollister told me that the group had a great tour of the facility 
followed by a session with their quality control staff who explained how things 
are done at the facility. From my perspective, they must be doing things right 
because they make great ice cream! Are there other Cherry Garcia fans out 
there?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The SIGMAA has over 500 members, which is 
wonderful. There is interest in statistics education among mathematicians. And 
they are doing wonderful things in the classes they teach, if the proposals 
submitted for the Contributed Paper Session in Baltimore are a representative 
sample. Carolyn Cuff and I reviewed them all and had a hard time choosing from 
the many good papers that were submitted. Carolyn has asked six presenters to 
prepare for an extended session so that they can involve the audience as 
students. I imagine that both presenters and audience members will gain from 
this approach. Save Friday and Saturday mornings for these sessions.</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the first time in a long time, I am not 
teaching a semester course in Statistics. I am teaching short units in 
Statistics and Probability for our preservice elementary students, and I bemoan 
the fact that the time is so short. Lately, my work has taken me into Rhode 
Island middle schools to observe and work with teachers on standards-based 
instruction. Many teachers are using reform curriculum materials in which 
probability and descriptive statistics have a prominent place, but sadly, many 
teachers have very inadequate backgrounds in these areas. The 'ahas' that 
teachers have during our workshops are great for them and their students, but 
they occur in areas that I consider to be fundamental statistical concepts, 
including shape, center, spread. I can't help but think of Liping Ma's book from 
which the expression 'profound understanding of fundamental mathematics' or PUFM 
(pronounced puffem) emerged, and I want to say that there is a great need for 
PUFSI or profound understanding of fundamental statistics ideas among middle 
school teachers. If you have the chance, please offer your expertise-the next 
generation of our students will be stronger for it.</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Speaking of the next generation, the SIGMAA is 
sponsoring a panel discussion at the JMM in January entitled "The State of 
Statistics Education." It takes place on Saturday afternoon. The speakers are 
all excellent and have combined expertise that spans the statistics spectrum. 
Tom Moore of Grinnell College in Iowa, who led the American Statistical 
Association (ASA) team charged with giving feedback to the National Council of 
Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) on their latest version of content standards, is 
the moderator. Joan Garfield, who is soon to become the Chair of the Section on 
Statistics Education for the ASA, will share with us how the first course in 
statistics has changed over the past ten years. Gail Burrill, former president 
of NCTM, will prompt us to think about the changes that the college statistics 
course might make to accommodate for increased statistical understanding among 
high school graduates. Allan Rossman, mindful of the impact of the AP exam in 
statistics, will discuss what a second course at the college level might look 
like and have us consider statistics courses that are data based for students 
who have taken calculus. There will be time for audience participation, so I 
hope you will join us.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Our SIGMAA meeting is Thursday evening. Please 
come prepared to participate in discussion about creating an activity resource 
book for teachers of statistics. Carolyn and I have been approached to consider 
this, but we need your help. If you have a great activity that you would like us 
to consider, bring it with you to the meeting.</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Elections are coming up. Dex Whittinghill, past 
chair, serves as head of the Nominating Committee, so look for email from him in 
the next few weeks. When the slate is finished, please vote!</font><font

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At Mathfest 2002, the SIGMAA on Statistics 
Education sponsored a statistics tour of Ben &amp; Jerry’s in Waterbury, VT for 
members of the SIGMAA. (Space permitting, nonmembers were allowed on the tour, 
but had to pay $15 for transportation. There was no charge for members.) Our 
chair, Mary Sullivan, arranged the tour and arranged for transportation from the 
convention center with Mountain Transit, Inc.</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Eleven (11) of us went on the tour and all enjoyed 
it. We left the convention center in a school bus shortly after Robin Lock’s 
talk (Fun and Games for Teaching Statistics). Robin went on the 
tour.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We took the regular tour, accompanied by Daron 
Byerly (Ben &amp; Jerry’s statistician). During the tour we got to taste some 
Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream (Cherry Garcia and Chocolate Chip<font 
color=#0000ff> </font>Cookie Dough) and then shop in their gift 
store.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When we met with Daron for about an hour 
afterwards, he told us about:</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1) statistical process control (SPC) applications 
to B &amp; J’s production line,</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2) the software he uses for SPC (Infinity 
QM),</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3) the training in statistics that he gives the 
employees of B &amp; J’s (He gave each of us a copy of the workbook he had 
developed.),</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4) some experiments he had designed (He gave us 
handouts on them).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We had many questions for Daron and he had a few 
for us. Since he is primarily concerned with limiting the variance in the 
production processes, Daron was especially interested in any advice we could 
give him about analyzing variance in multifactor experiments where the data is 
not normal.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After the interesting hour with Daron, we returned 
to Mathfest, arriving just in time for the beginning of the afternoon 
sessions.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Note: The participants were: Nkechi Agwu, Bob 
Hollister, Larry Knop (and two undergrads from Hamilton College), Robin Lock, 
Deborah Lurie (and her husband, Barry), Claire McAndrew, and Jon Scott (and 
guest).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

the Joint Statistical Meetings</font></font> <br><font

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This last August 11-15, the Joint Statistical 
Meetings (JSMs) were held in New York City. This yearly meeting was sponsored by 
several organizations, and this year they were the American Statistical 
Association (ASA), the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the International 
Biometrics Society’s Eastern and Western North American Regions, and the 
Statistical Society of Canada. Although the JSM program does not show it, your 
SIGMAA on Stat Ed sponsored a Topic Contributed Panel titled "The Role of 
Undergraduate Mathematics for Statistics and Vice Versa." We sponsored it in the 
sense that ‘yours truly’ organized the panel and the SIGMAA helped to cover the 
travel expenses of the mathematicians on the panel. An ASA Topic Contributed 
Panel is not quite as prestigious as one of its Invited Panels, but it WAS a 
panel and the five speakers WERE invited!</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The panel presented the highlights of the CRAFTY 
(Curriculum Reform and the First Two Years) workshop held in October of 2000, at 
Grinnell College, where mathematicians and statisticians discussed "What aspects 
of the undergraduate mathematics curriculum are of most value to statistics?" It 
was one of many workshops where mathematicians exchanged information and ideas 
with client and partner disciplines (like statistics). The Grinnell workshop 
participants added two questions of their own:</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What statistical concepts are important for 
students in mathematical science?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What statistical concepts are important for 
students in quantitative disciplines?</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the 17 reports that resulted from these 
meetings is the one for statistics. To see it, go to the website</font><font

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and look for CF_Statistics.doc.</font><font 
face=Arial,Helvetica></font> 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The speakers in the panel were to be Deborah 
Hughes Hallett of the University of Arizona, Steven B. Horton of the U.S. 
Military Academy, Robert R. Starbuck of Wyeth Research, Kay B. Somers of 
Moravian College, and Allan Rossman of Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. All five were 
at the Grinnell workshop, with Deborah, Steve and Kay as mathematicians, and Bob 
and Allan as statisticians. Deborah gave the background for the workshops, 
deciphered what CRAFTY and CUPM (Committee on Undergraduate Programs in 
Mathematics, of which CRAFTY is a subcommittee) were, and gave an overview of 
CRAFTY questions. Then Steve talked about the ‘Understanding and Content’ 
questions, Bob the ‘Technology’ questions, Steve the ‘Instructional 
Interconnections and Techniques’ questions (he had to present Kay’s slides at 
the last minute), and Allan the ‘place of statistics within the mathematics 
curriculum’ question. You can read the report for details!</font><font
