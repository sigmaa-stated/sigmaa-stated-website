The business meeting for the SIGMAA was held Thursday evening.&nbsp; Secretary 
Julie Clark has distributed full minutes.&nbsp; The new officers were 
introduced:</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

University, <a href="mailto:lacke@rowan.edu">lacke@rowan.edu</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Carolyn Cuff moves to Past-Chair; Julie Clark (Hollins 
University, <a href="mailto:jclark@hollins.edu">jclark@hollins.edu</a>) 
continues as Treasurer for another year.</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Numerous upcoming events were announced (see more on these below).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
There was some discussion on the charter, proposals to amend it has been made by 
Nkechi Agwu.&nbsp; It was decided that the executive committee would check the 
charter carefully this year both for our purposes and for some changes coming 
from MAA and forward any proposals to the membership.</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
An informal (non-scientific) poll of attendees present at the time was taken on 
the question “What do you allow students to use for tests – notecards, open 
book, etc?”&nbsp; The answers were</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1 – nothing</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1 – notecard</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
10 – open book</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
6 – instructor supplies formulas</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1 – notebook of “10 points” – there are 40 points on each test.</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1 – lets class discuss what’s important during review, and leaves it on the 
board</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1 – anything except a computer</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1 – test has two parts – take-home (anything allowed), in class (nothing 
allowed)</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
2 – 8-1/2 by 11 “notecard”</p>

<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The SIGMAA sponsored two sessions at the meetings.&nbsp; The first was a panel 
discussion Thursday afternoon.&nbsp; The topic for discussion was “The 
undergraduate mathematical statistics sequence.&nbsp; Allan Rossman (Ca Poly, 
San Luis Obispo) was moderator; the panelists were Matthew Hassett (ASA, 
AdvancePCS) who presented the views of a working actuary, Elliot Tanis (Hope 
College), and Deborah Nolan (UC Berkeley).&nbsp; The discussion basically 
revolved around three issues:</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
1.&nbsp; What’s good about the sequence? </p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
2.&nbsp; What’s bad about the sequence, and</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
3.&nbsp; Recommendations for change.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The general consensus was that although the sequence has 
problems and could stand some revisions we still need it.&nbsp; Some suggested 
that students should have an applied course before tackling the mathematical 
version.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The SIGMAA also sponsored a contributed paper session “Discourse on Inference” 
on Friday morning.&nbsp; There were 12 presentations, which were very 
good.&nbsp; Attendance at the session was good; however in informal polling we 
found that well over half of the attendees were not members of the SIGMAA!&nbsp; 
Membership forms were distributed to those interested.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A short summary of each presentation is below.&nbsp; There is a second 
attachment to this e-mail with the abstract for each talk.&nbsp; For more 
information, please contact the presenter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Why Do We Check Assumptions for Inference?” – Allan Rossman and Beth Chance 
(Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo)</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Allan and Beth presented JAVA applets to demonstrate coverage rates for 
confidence intervals in situations where the assumptions are not met. Those can 
be found on their website, www.rossmanchance.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allan 
also mentioned the case of using inference improperly – a sample of 100 people 
(US Senators) found 14 women and 86 men.&nbsp; Based on this sample a 95% 
confidence interval for the proportion of women in the population is 7.2% to 
20.8%.&nbsp; BUT – the sample is not random; furthermore, students do not need a 
confidence interval to estimate the proportion of women in the Senate!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Developing and Understanding Confidence Intervals for Proportions” – Daniel 
Teague, NC School of Science and Mathematics, (<a 
href="mailto:teague@ncssm.edu">teague@ncssm.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Dan presented some ideas related to activities he used to demonstrate confidence 
intervals in his classes, including the “human confidence interval” idea.&nbsp; 
Students line up as possible proportions (each representing 1/n of the 
class).&nbsp; For various sample sizes and observed proportions, they “step 
forward” if their personal proportion is reasonable for the population.&nbsp; 
They can visually see how the intervals behave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Order Statistics, Uniform Distributions, and Confidence Intervals” – Michael 
Ratliff, Northern Arizona University, (<a 
href="mailto:Michael.Ratliff@nau.edu">Michael.Ratliff@nau.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Michael discussed finding confidence intervals using order statistics where one 
has a sample from U[0,b] where the objective is to find the shortest interval to 
estimate the unknown maximum b.&nbsp; He uses Mathematica in his class with 
graphical approaches, the linear simplex method, etc.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Question based presentation of inferential methods” – Michael Landringham, 
Idaho State University, (<a 
href="mailto:landmich@isu.edu">landmich@isu.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He asks questions leading up to the idea of a confidence interval (and the fact 
that one doesn’t need to know µ.&nbsp; For example, what is the chance x-bar is 
within $0.40&nbsp; (or $0.50) of the population mean if µ = $8.50 (or $9.30) and 
s = $2.10, etc.&nbsp; The point is to get students to realize the probability 
depends on s, not on µ.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“What does a P-value mean?” – Patricia Humphrey, Georgia Southern University, 
(<a 
href="mailto:phumphre@georgiasouthern.edu">phumphre@georgiasouthern.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This is a low-tech way to demonstrate p-values to a class based on the idea of 
an altered deck of cards.&nbsp; To answer the question “Is the deck fair?” each 
student draws a card and the number of reds and blacks is tallied.&nbsp; 
Simulation with a TI-83 calculator approximates the probability of the observed 
count to approximate a p-value.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Hands-on experiments in inferential statistics” – Mohammed Salmassi, Framingham 
State College, (<a 
href="mailto:msalmas@frc.mass.edu">msalmas@frc.mass.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He uses several ideas from the Schaeffer, et al book in his class.&nbsp; Some 
examples are weighing small boxes of raisins, using the penny age an random 
rectangles to develop confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Using Simulations to Teach the Meaning of the P-value.” – Murray Siegel, Sam 
Houston State University, (<a 
href="mailto:mth_mhs@shsu.edu">mth_mhs@shsu.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He discussed two simulations.&nbsp; The first involved a company that is hiring 
30 technicians.&nbsp; Forty percent of the qualified applicants are female; only 
eight are hired.&nbsp; Is this evidence of hiring bias?&nbsp; What is the 
probability, based on simulation of eight or fewer females being hired?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second involved selection of one’s favorite cable network 
from choices CNN, ESPN, HBO and QVC.&nbsp; This is used to illustrate the 
Chi-squared distribution (with null hypotheses equal likelihood).&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Using Visual Tools in the Teaching of Hypothesis Testing” – Chris Lacke, Rowan 
University, (<a href="mailto:lacke@rowan.edu">lacke@rowan.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chris uses JMP and descriptive statistics and graphs.&nbsp; He also demonstrated 
JMP’s ability to do p-value and power animations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“Using Simulations, Permutations and Randomizations to help Students Understand 
P-values” – Robin Lock, St. Lawrence University, (<a 
href="mailto:rlock@stlawu.edu">rlock@stlawu.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Robin used an example relating the payrolls of major league baseball teams to 
ask if the payroll for those who make the playoffs significantly higher than 
those who don’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He demonstrated simulations using a deck of 
30 cards (each with a team payroll and drawing eight card to represent playoff 
teams), and also using Fathom for more intensive simulation.&nbsp; Fathom was 
also used to scramble the available data to ask whether the correlation between 
salary and number of wins was positive (it was for the 2003 season).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p

“Teaching Statistical Inference to In-service Middle School Teachers: 
Methodologies, Activities, and Projects” – Barbara Wainwright, Salisbury 
University, (<a 
href="mailto:bawainwright@salisbury.edu">bawainwright@salisbury.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Barbara works with middle school teachers and shared some strategies she uses as 
well as some projects actually done by students in her class.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
“An Interdisciplinary Approach to Teaching Statistics to Undergraduate Life 
Science Majors Provides Numerous Opportunities for Data Analysis Projects 
Involving Inference” – Deborah Lurie, Saint Joseph’s University, (<a 
href="mailto:lurie@sju.edu">lurie@sju.edu</a>).</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Deborah and her co-authors have collaborated with the Biology department to 
develop a course (with NSF funding).&nbsp; The Intro Statistics course is taught 
concurrently with the first Cellular Biology course.&nbsp; The two share data 
analysis projects (data collected in the Biology lab is analyzed in Statistics), 
and the analysis reported back to the Biology lab.&nbsp; At the end of the 
semester, each student designs an experiment of their own an analyzes the 
results which are communicated with a poster presentation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p

“Hypothesis Test Selection:&nbsp; A Practical Method.” – Sue Shou, Idaho State 
University, (<a href="mailto:shousue@isu.edu">shousue@isu.edu</a>)</p>
<p 
class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Sue presented a series of questions students should ask themselves when trying 
to determine which is the proper test to consider for a situation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">Perhaps most notable in this 
category was Ann Watkins’ presentation as retiring MAA past president, 
“Fallacies in Elementary Statistics,”&nbsp; which included some subtle 
differences between the mean, median, and mode.&nbsp; “Which average would you 
use to answer the following question: “What speed are you going if the number of 
cars you pass is equal to the number that pass you?”&nbsp; The text answer was 
median; she used an example to shoe that the mean is the correct average.&nbsp; 
She also explored the idea of bimodality – heights of men and women.&nbsp; How 
far do two distributions have to be from one another for a mixture to appear 
bimodal?&nbsp; Helguerro (1904) said two standard deviations, she said really 
3.&nbsp; BUT – bimodality can happen by chance – she gave an example from 
simulation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Ann also addressed the California K-12 standards and said they are not rigorous 
with respect to statistics (and contain a fair bit of nonsense); not surprising 
when no statistician was involved!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She went on to discuss the “average class size” fallacy and said there were two 
points of view and two sets of numbers: administration and students and they are 
different.&nbsp; Administration says average class size is 12, but students sit 
in classes of 200!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">Other statistics related
